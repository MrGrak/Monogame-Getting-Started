<h1>Building MonoGame Source Code</h1>


<p>
This section is for those who need to modify monogame's source code to fit a specific need or platform.<br>
If this is your first time using monogame, it's not recommended that you start by building the source.<br>
You should have a solid understand of how monogame works before proceeding.<br>
</p>

<br><br>


<h3>Use Git to clone Monogame Develop Branch</h3>
<p>
this section assumes you know what git is and how to use it.<br>
if you don't know how to use git, learn it.<br>
<br>
in a folder, assuming you have git installed, open a cmd prompt.<br>
you can open a cmd prompt from any window by typing 'cmd' into the address bar (on windows).<br>
<br>
clone development branch of monogame:<br>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
git clone -b develop https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame
cd MonoGame
git submodule init
git submodule update
</textarea>
</p>


<br>
<h3>Build the monogame tools, using vs2019 or later</h3>
<p>
	you can find the build solution here: PARENT\MonoGame\MonoGame.Tools.Windows.sln<br>
	you need to change the build settings on the project.<br>
		near the top, to the right of debug, any cpu, there are two drop downs.<br>
		change the 2nd dropdown, on the right, to: Framework -> net452<br>
	you might need to update .net sdk to support later version of netcore.<br>
		as of this writing, .NET Core 3.1 is required.<br>
	make sure that it produces the following exe:<br>
	\MonoGame\Artifacts\MonoGame.Content.Builder.Editor\Wpf\Debug\mgcb-editor-wpf.exe<br>
	launching this exe gives you the familiar mgcb editor we all know and love<br>
</p>

<br>
<h3>Build the monogame .dll (+ mg tools)</h3>
<p>
	open MonoGame.Framework.sln in Monogame/ folder<br>
	note that it's setup to build a class lib .dll<br>
	build it, locate the MonoGame.Framework.dll.<br>
</p>
