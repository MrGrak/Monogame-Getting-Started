<h1>Adding Sounds</h1>


<p>In this article, we will add background music and a sound effect to your game's pipeline tool, and build the assets into a XNBs. <br>
This article assumes that you have already <a href="BuildingFirstProject.html" target="display">Built A MonoGame Project</a>.<br>
Let's get started.</p>
<br>




<h3>Copy the Sound Assets</h3>
<p>
First, you'll need to download the two sound files below.<br>
The first sound "IotaPart1.wav" is a track of music that we will use as looping background music.<br>
The second sound "8bitBark.wav" is a sound effect that we will play when the spacebar is pressed.<br>
Right click each link and choose 'Save As...' then save it to your project's Content folder.<br>
Make sure the sounds have the .WAV file extension.<br>
</p>


<br><br>
<center><a href="../Assets/IotaPart1.wav" >IotaPart1.wav</a></center><br>
<center><a href="../Assets/8bitBark.wav" >8bitBark.wav</a></center>
<br><br>





<h3>Launch the Pipeline Tool</h3>
<p>
Navigate to your project's Content folder and double click on Content.mgcb.
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/addSound1.jpg"></center>
<br><br>

<p>
The pipeline tool will open. <br>
Note that you have opened your game's .mgcb file, which is linked to your game project.<br>
You will start with an empty pipeline window like below.<br>
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/addTex2.jpg"></center>
<br><br>












<h3>Add the Sound Assets</h3>
<p>
Now we will add our downloaded sound files to the pipeline tool.<br>
Click Edit > Add > Existing Item...
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/addTex3.jpg"></center>
<br><br>

<p>
Locate the downloaded sounds in the file browser.<br>
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/addSound2.jpg"></center>
<br><br>

<p>
Select both sound files, then click the 'open' button.<br>
Now your content pipeline window should look like below.<br>
These sound files will default to being imported as SoundEffects.<br>
This information can be found in the lower left hand corner of the pipeline window.<br>
Note the Build Action, Importer, Processor, and Quality settings.
</p>
<br><br>

<br><br>















<h3>Build the Pipeline Assets</h3>
<p>
Now let's build our sounds to XNB files.<br>
Click Build > Build, or press F6.<br>
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/addSound4.jpg"></center>
<br><br>

<p>
The results of building should look like below.
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/addSound5.jpg"></center>
<br><br>

<p>
Note that two additional folders have been added to your Content folder, <b>bin</b> and <b>obj</b>.
Don't worry too much about understanding why these folders exist right now.
You do need to know that the XNBs that were built exist in the <b>bin</b> folder.
My project is a Windows OpenGL project, so my XNBs are located at <b>/bin/DesktopGL</b>.
Navigate to your XNB files and inspect their properties. 
You can see that the WAV files were transformed into XNBs with the same name.
</p>
<br><br>

<br><br>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Your sound assets are now ready to be loaded into your game and played.
We'll cover this in the next article <a href="SoundPlaying.html" target="display">Playing Sounds</a>.
