<h1>Window Focus</h1>

<p>

Window focus just means that the game window is the current window in the foreground.<br>
Let's say you are playing a game, which requires keyboard input. You switch to another<br>
window, and start typing. But, you notice that the game is still responding to your input!<br>
That's bad, a window that doesn't have focus shouldn't respond to user input, in most cases.<br>
<br>

In this article, we will explore how to prevent user input from being processed when the window<br>
loses focus. Let's get started.<br>
<br>


<h3>Example Code</h3>

I will assume you know what public static classes/singletons are, since this example will be using<br>
one, to keep it super simple. First, let's create a class that contains a bool to represent if our<br>
game has focus or not.<br>

<br>
<textarea rows="5" readonly>
public static class Data
{
	bool windowFocused;
}
</textarea>	<br>
<br>

Next, let's subscribe our game to the activated and deactivated events.<br>

<br>
<textarea rows="20" readonly>
public Game1()
{
	//...game constructor code
	
	Activated += IsActivated;
	Deactivated += IsDeactivated;
}

private void IsDeactivated(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	Data.windowFocused = false;
}

private void IsActivated(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	if(Data.windowFocused == false)
	{ Data.windowFocused = true; }
}
</textarea>	<br>
<br>

Then later in code, we can check to see if the window has focus like so.<br>

<br>
<textarea rows="1" readonly>
if(Data.windowFocused){ ... }
</textarea>	<br>
<br>

There are many different ways to accomplish this, so feel free to make your own to fit<br>
into your game, according to the patterns you have chosen.<br>
