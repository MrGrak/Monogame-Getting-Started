<h1>Playing Sounds</h1>

<p>In this article, we will play background music and a sound effect. <br>
This article assumes that you have completed the  <a href="SoundAdding.html" target="display">Adding Sounds</a> tutorial.<br>
Let's get started.</p>
<br>


<h3>Update Game1 to Load and Play the Sound Files</h3>
<p>
Replace Game1's code with the code below.
</p>

<textarea rows="60" readonly>
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input;

using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio;

namespace Game1
{
    public class Game1 : Game
    {
        GraphicsDeviceManager graphics;
        SpriteBatch spriteBatch;

        SoundEffect music;
        SoundEffect bark;
        SoundEffectInstance musicInstance;
        SoundEffectInstance barkInstance;

        public Game1()
        {
            graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);
            Content.RootDirectory = "Content";
        }

        protected override void Initialize() { base.Initialize(); }

        protected override void LoadContent()
        {
            spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);

            music = Content.Load<SoundEffect>("IotaPart1");
            musicInstance = music.CreateInstance();
            musicInstance.IsLooped = true;
            musicInstance.Play();

            bark = Content.Load<SoundEffect>("8bitBark");
            barkInstance = bark.CreateInstance();
        }

        protected override void UnloadContent() { }

        protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)
        {
            if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Space)) { barkInstance.Play(); }
            base.Update(gameTime);
        }

        protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
        {
            GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);
            base.Draw(gameTime);
        }
    }
}

<p>
There shouldn't be any errors in your project.<br>
Build the project. You should see a window like below.<br>
Music will start playing.<br>
If you press the spacebar keyboard button, a sound resembling a bark will play.<br>
You can hold down the keyboard button to continuously play the barking sound.<br>
</p>

<h3>Inspect Game1.cs</h3>
<p>
Lets inspect the changes we made to Game1.cs.<br>
First, since we are using sound files, we need to tell Game1.cs where to find Monogame's sound classes.<br>
This is done by the code below, which essentially 'imports' the audio classes defined in the Xna Framework.<br>
Recall that Monogame is based on XNA.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>SoundEffect and SoundEffectInstance</h3>

<p>
A SoundEffect loads a sound file. <br>
A SoundEffectInstance plays, loops, pauses, stops, and restarts a sound loaded via SoundEffect.<br>
You can have multiple SoundEffectInstances playing the same SoundEffect.<br>
<br>
You can load and play a soundfile using just a SoundEffect, but that's all you can do - 
you can't loop it, stop it, pause it, or restart it. <br>
It's suggested that <b>you should always create a SoundEffectInstance to control a sound in your game.</b><br>
Inside Game1.cs we create two SoundEffects and two SoundEffectInstances.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="7" readonly>
SoundEffect music;
SoundEffect bark;
SoundEffectInstance musicInstance;
SoundEffectInstance barkInstance;
</textarea>	








<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Inspect LoadContent()</h3>
<p>
In the LoadContent method we actually load the sound XNBs into our ContentManager, called Content.<br>
We set the SoundEffect variables to equal our loaded content.<br>
Then we create the SoundEffectInstances that will play and control our loaded sound files.<br>
Note that we set our musicInstance to loop, with the line <i>musicInstance.IsLooped = true;</i>.<br>
Also note that we begin playing the game's music with the line <i>musicInstance.Play();</i>.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="15" readonly>
protected override void LoadContent()
{
	spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);

	music = Content.Load<SoundEffect>("IotaPart1");
	musicInstance = music.CreateInstance();
	musicInstance.IsLooped = true;
	musicInstance.Play();

	bark = Content.Load<SoundEffect>("8bitBark");
	barkInstance = bark.CreateInstance();
}
</textarea>	





<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Inspect Update()</h3>
<p>
Finally, we modified Update() to play the bark sound if the user has pressed the spacebar.<br>
Note that we are only checking to see if the spacebar is being held down.<br>
This means that <i>SoundEffectInstance.Play()</i> will be called every frame that spacebar is held down.<br>
A SoundEffectInstance can only Play() if it's state is Paused or Stopped.<br>
This means that bark will only play again once the sound has reached it's end.
</p>
<textarea rows="8" readonly>
protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)
{
	if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Space)) { barkInstance.Play(); }
	base.Update(gameTime);
}
</textarea>	






<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Your sound assets are now playing in your game.<br>
The next step is to modify their volume, pause, stop, play, and loop your sounds.
