<h1>Save File Paths</h1>


<p>
In this article, we will explore options you have for saving files to disc.<br>
Please note that saving files on Windows requires a different path than saving files on Mac or Linux.<br>
<br>
First, it's important to note that Monogame has removed the storage class. See this discussion:<br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4311">
https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4311</a><br>
<br>
So, if you're migrating from Xna to Monogame, the storage class wont be available to use.<br>
You'll need to handle it yourself, which can vary widely based on platform.<br>
Let's take a look at save file paths on Windows, Mac, and Linux.<br>
<br>




<h3>Saving Files To Application Folder (Windows)</h3>
There are many options for saving files on Windows, but there are hidden pitfalls as well.<br>
First, lets take a look at the naive way of saving files to the game's application directory:<br>
<br>
<textarea rows="1" readonly>
string SavePath = Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetEntryAssembly().Location) + @"\";
</textarea>	<br>
<br>
You may think this is a working solution, but it isn't! Some windows users wont have permissions<br>
to write to this directory. This means they won't be able to save their game! So, we must<br>
consider alternative locations to save data to.<br>
<br>


<h3>Saving Files To AppData (Windows)</h3>
Windows applications often store their data and settings in an AppData folder, and each Windows <br>
user account has its own. It’s a hidden folder, so you’ll only see it if you show hidden files <br>
in the file manager. Each user account has its own AppData folder with its own contents. This <br>
allows Windows programs to store multiple sets of settings if a computer is used by multiple people. <br>
<br>
The AppData folder was introduced on Windows Vista, and is still in use on Windows 10, 8, and 7 today.<br>
This will target the directory: //C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\MyGame\<br>
<b>This is the suggested way of storing files on Windows:</b><br>
<br>
<textarea rows="1" readonly>
string SavePath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData), "MyGame");
</textarea>	<br>
<br>





<br><br>
You may need to store data for ALL users. In that case, you need to look into using CommonApplicationData:<br>
This will target the directory: //C:\ProgramData\MyGame\<br>
<br>
<textarea rows="1" readonly>
string SavePath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData), "MyGame");
</textarea>	<br>
<br>





<br><br>
You can also choose to store save data in LocalApplicationData:<br>
This will target the directory: //C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\MyGame\<br>
<br>
<textarea rows="1" readonly>
string SavePath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData), "MyGame");
</textarea>	<br>
<br>



<br><br>
You may want to save game files to the MyDocuments folder. Alright, buckle up.<br>
This will target the directory: //C:\Users\UserName\Documents\MyGame\<br>
<br>
<textarea rows="1" readonly>
string SavePath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.MyDocuments), "MyGame");
</textarea>	<br>
<br>
Please note that on Windows 8.1, due to the addition of SkyDrive, this path will return <br>
"C:\Users\Administrator\SkyDrive\Documents\MyGame\" - which is really great. Good job Microsoft.<br>
Note that Skydrive was renamed to OneDrive, because Microsoft was sued by Sky.<br>
Also note that Window's Updates will occasionally reset some random settings, which may alter this path further.<br>
You having fun yet? No? Well, let's explore saving for Mac now.<br>




<br><br><br>
<h3>Saving Files For Mac</h3>
Prepare yourself mentally. On Mac OSX, the save file path needs to look something like this:<br>
<b>"/Users/bob/Library/Application Support/MyGame/"</b><br>
Note that there is a space in Application Support. That's important. In order to get this path, use this code:<br>
<br>
<textarea rows="2" readonly>
string SavePath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile), "Library", "Application Support", "MyGame");
</textarea>	<br>
<br>




<br><br>
<h3>Saving Files For Linux</h3>
First, reevaluate if you really need to support Linux. Are the majority of your players using Linux?<br>
If you answered "yes" to that question, then continue. If you answered "no", do not continue further.<br>
There are many possible configurations of Linux and supporting all of them may not be possible.<br>
So, assuming you <b>absolutely must do this</b>, here's the path you'll (probably) need:<br>
"/home/bob/.local/share/MyGame/"<br>
Implementing this path is left up to the reader. Here's a starting point: "~/.local/share/MyGame"<br>
Have fun.<br>

<h3>What about SDL_GetPrefPath?</h3>
Monogame doesn't use SDL for the DirectX templates (as of 2021), so this isn't available for this project.<br>
For the OpenGL template, sure, use SDL_GetPrefPath. Here's a link to what it will return: 
<a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GetPrefPath">https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GetPrefPath</a><br>
<br>


<br><br><br>
<h3>What about Proton? Or Console platforms?</h3>
Console savepaths are implemented specifically, and you'll need to be a registered developer to get acess to the<br>
samples and examples that will guide you through this process. Good luck.<br>
