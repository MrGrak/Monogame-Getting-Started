##ToDo
+ discuss differences between opengl, directx, uwp projects (the big 3)
+ writing systems from scratch, and why instead of using existing library
+ writing simple ui (rectangles, click state, buttons, text)
+ writing a collision system (prevent rec overlap)
+ writing a platformer physics system
+ writing a top down physics system
+ writing a game menu system (inventory screen)
+ writing a particle system (using a pool, cursor ui)
+ writing a music player for looped bkg music
+ writing a music player for non-looped bkg music

##Making An Action Platformer - The Vlambeer Example
+ basic example (platformer, enemy, input, gun shoots bullets, enemy death)
+ basic animations and sound (jump anim, walk anim, moving hair, shooting sfx, jump sfx)
+ lower enemy hp + better enemy animations
+ higher rate of fire on gun (only way player can interact with world)
+ more enemies (more world interaction)
+ bigger bullets, muzzle flash, faster bullets (easier to read action)
+ less accurate bullets, impact effects (wall impact sprites)
+ enemy hit animation + knockback (white flash)
+ permanence (enemy corpses stay on ground)
+ 2d camera, lerping and camera movement
+ camera peeking, centering on action
+ screenshake - enemy hit, gun shooting
+ player knockback 
+ sleep, slow motion player death
+ strafing (walking backwards while shooting)
+ more permanence - bullet casings
+ more bullets x3, random enemy death explosions
+ more enemies, faster enemies
+ camera kickback opposite direction of gun firing
+ smoke particles added for enemy explosions
+ player death, slow motion, game over game state





##Improvements
+ improve fullscreen article to handle rendering fullscreen at ultra wide resolutions

##Timing Tests - should be diff repo/section in site
+ create timing test for drawing sprites (at various sizes - 16, 32, 64, 128)
+ create timing test for drawing vector and bitmap fonts
+ create timing test for drawing rectangles
+ create timing test for drawing to RenderTarget2D
